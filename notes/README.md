FHDL - Fragmented HDL, brings a new way to write codes for programming FPGA
> 1)consists of a formal system to describe signals, combinatorial and synchronous statements operating on them.
> 2) Formal system is low level and close to synthesizable subset of Verilog. 
> 3) relies on Python to build comples structures by combining FHDL elements.
> 4) contains a back-end to produce synthesizable Verilog. 

1) Installation: myexample.py : a simple UP counter, prints its counting on console.
